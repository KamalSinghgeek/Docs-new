## üìù Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Access Your Google Account**

First, you need to access your Google account to configure the necessary settings.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Go to Google Account Settings**:
   - Navigate to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com).
2. **Sign In**:

   - Use your Gmail credentials to sign into your Google account.

3. **Manage Gmail Account**:
   - Click on **Manage your Gmail account**.

üí° **Tip**: Ensure that you‚Äôre logged into the Gmail account that you wish to use for sending emails.

---

### **Step 2: Enable Two-Step Verification**

For added security, you must enable two-step verification.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Navigate to Security Settings**:

   - In the left sidebar, click on **Security**.

2. **Enable Two-Step Verification**:
   - Locate **Two-Step Verification** under the signing-in options and follow the instructions to enable it. This will require you to enter a verification code sent to your phone or email.

üí° **Tip**: This extra layer of security is necessary for generating an app-specific password in the next steps.

---

### **Step 3: Generate App-Specific Password**

Once two-step verification is enabled, you'll need to generate an app-specific password for Fleet Stack.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Navigate to App Passwords**:

   - Under the **Signing into Google** section, click **App Passwords**.

2. **Create App-Specific Password**:

   - If **App Passwords** is not visible, ensure **Two-Step Verification** is enabled.
   - Select the app you want to generate the password for (choose ‚ÄúMail‚Äù for email), and then click **Create**.

3. **Copy the Generated Password**:
   - Google will display a 16-character app-specific password. Copy and save it securely.
   - **Note**: Google will not display this password again, so make sure to save it before leaving the page.

üí° **Tip**: Use a password manager to securely store your app-specific passwords.

---

### **Step 4: Configure SMTP Settings**

Now, open Fleet Stack and input the necessary SMTP settings to connect your Gmail account.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Open Fleet Stack**:

   - Navigate to the **SMTP Configuration** section in the Fleet Stack software.

2. **Fill in the SMTP Details**:

   - **Encryption Type**: SSL
   - **SMTP Host URL**: smtp.gmail.com
   - **SMTP Port**: 587
   - **Email**: Enter your Gmail email address
   - **Sender Name**: Enter the name you want to display for sent emails
   - **Username**: Enter your Gmail email address
   - **Password**: Enter the app-specific password generated earlier

3. **Save Configuration**:
   - Click **Update SMTP Credentials** to save the settings.

üí° **Tip**: Double-check all entered fields, especially the SMTP host and port settings, to ensure a successful connection.

---

### **Step 5: Test SMTP Configuration**

Once the SMTP settings are entered, you can test the connection to ensure everything is working correctly.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Test SMTP**:
   - Use the **Test SMTP** section to send a test email and verify the configuration.
2. **Verify Test Email**:
   - Check if you receive the test email in your inbox. If not, review the configuration and try again.

üí° **Tip**: If the test fails, check for common issues like incorrect app passwords or disabled two-step verification.

---

## üö® Important Notes

- **Security**: Always keep your app-specific password secure. If you believe it has been compromised, revoke it from the Google account settings and generate a new one.
- **Account Limits**: Google has a sending limit for Gmail accounts. If you exceed this limit, you may face temporary restrictions on sending emails.

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have successfully configured Gmail‚Äôs SMTP service for use within Fleet Stack. This will enable email notifications and other email-dependent features in the software.

Always remember to keep your credentials secure and update them whenever necessary.
