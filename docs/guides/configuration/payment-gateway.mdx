--- ## üìù Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Access the Super Admin Panel**

To begin the setup process, log into the Fleet Stack Super Admin Panel.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Log In**:

   - On the login page, click the **Super Admin** button.
   - Enter your Super Admin credentials to log in.

2. **Verify Software Status**:
   - Confirm whether the Fleet Stack software is active or inactive. The status will help you ensure that the system is ready for configuration.

üí° **Tip**: Ensure that you're logged in as a Super Admin, as you‚Äôll need elevated privileges for the payment gateway configuration.

---

### **Step 2: Navigate to Software Configuration**

Once logged in, you need to access the configuration section to enter your payment details.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Go to the Dashboard**:
   - On the main dashboard, locate and click the **Software Configuration** button.
2. **Access the Payment Gateway Section**:
   - Look for the section dedicated to payment configurations.

üí° **Tip**: If you can't find the **Software Configuration** button, check if your user role has the necessary permissions to access this area.

---

### **Step 3: Enter Payment Gateway Details**

Now, you‚Äôll need to input your Razorpay credentials to enable the payment gateway integration.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Razorpay Merchant ID**:

   - Enter the **Razorpay Merchant ID** provided by Razorpay. This is a unique identifier for your Razorpay account.

2. **Razorpay Secret Key**:
   - Enter the **Razorpay Secret Key** that you received from Razorpay. This key is used to authenticate the communication between Fleet Stack and Razorpay.

üí° **Tip**: Double-check the Merchant ID and Secret Key to ensure they are entered correctly. Incorrect credentials may cause issues with transaction processing.

---

### **Step 4: Validate Configuration**

Before saving the configuration, it‚Äôs important to verify that everything is correct.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Check Merchant ID**:

   - Ensure that the **Merchant ID** is entered exactly as provided by Razorpay.

2. **Check Secret Key**:
   - Verify that the **Secret Key** matches the credentials given by Razorpay.

üí° **Tip**: Even a small typo in the Merchant ID or Secret Key can result in failed transactions. It‚Äôs always a good idea to copy and paste these values directly from Razorpay.

---

### **Step 5: Test the Payment Gateway (Optional but Recommended)**

It‚Äôs highly recommended to test the payment gateway integration to ensure everything works as expected.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Conduct a Test Transaction**:

   - Use **Razorpay‚Äôs test environment** or **sandbox mode** to perform a test transaction. This allows you to check the functionality of the integration without processing real payments.

2. **Verify Test Results**:
   - Ensure that the transaction goes through successfully. Check if the correct amount is processed and the payment status updates accordingly.

üí° **Tip**: Testing in the sandbox environment can help you avoid errors in live transactions. Always test thoroughly before going live.

---

### **Step 6: Save Configuration**

Once you‚Äôve verified the details and tested the integration, save the configuration.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Click Save**:
   - After reviewing and confirming the details, click the **Save** button (or equivalent) to store the payment gateway settings.

üí° **Tip**: Make sure to save your changes before exiting the page to avoid losing your configuration.

---

### **Step 7: Monitor and Update as Needed**

Once the payment gateway is set up, it‚Äôs important to periodically check the settings.

#### Tasks to Complete:

1. **Monitor Gateway**:

   - Keep an eye on payment transactions to ensure everything is functioning properly.

2. **Update Credentials**:
   - If Razorpay updates their credentials (e.g., Merchant ID or Secret Key), make sure to update the settings in Fleet Stack accordingly.

üí° **Tip**: Set a reminder to periodically check Razorpay‚Äôs credentials for updates. This ensures that your payment gateway stays active and functional.

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will successfully integrate Razorpay‚Äôs payment gateway into Fleet Stack. This will enable you to handle transactions smoothly and efficiently. Be sure to monitor the payment system periodically and update your credentials when necessary.
