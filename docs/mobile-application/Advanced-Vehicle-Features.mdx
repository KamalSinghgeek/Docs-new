The **Advanced Features** section provides additional tools to enhance the management of vehicles. These features offer enhanced security and tracking capabilities, enabling administrators to have more control over fleet operations. You can manage vehicle immobilization, track vehicle locations, monitor unauthorized movement, and customize notification settings for specific needs.

### **Track Link Creation**:

This feature allows you to create a trackable link for a selected vehicle. You can set a validity period for the link, share it with others, and remove it when no longer needed. It provides the ability to track vehicles directly from the mobile app or via the shared link.

- **Select a vehicle**: Choose the vehicle you want to create the tracking link for from the list of available vehicles.
- **Set the validity period**: Define the time frame during which the link will be active. This allows you to control the duration of the tracking link's availability.
- **Tap **Share** to generate and share the link**: Once the link is created, tap the Share button to send it to others or use it to track the vehicle's location.
- **Use the **Delete Button** to remove the link**: When the link is no longer necessary, simply click the Delete button to deactivate it.

This feature allows for easy sharing and monitoring of a vehicle’s location in real-time, especially useful in fleet management scenarios where you need to provide tracking details to external parties or stakeholders.

    }}
  />

### **Immobilization**:

The Immobilization feature allows you to remotely disable a vehicle's engine to prevent it from being used. This feature enhances security by ensuring that the vehicle cannot be driven without proper authorization. It is especially helpful in cases of theft or when you need to temporarily stop a vehicle from operating.

- **Enable or disable the vehicle immobilization feature**: Use the toggle switch to activate or deactivate the immobilization feature. When enabled, the vehicle’s engine will be disabled, preventing it from starting.

This feature can be accessed directly from the vehicle's settings page, allowing you to immobilize the vehicle at any time from the app.

### **Parking Mode**:

Parking Mode is a security feature that alerts you if an unauthorized movement of the vehicle occurs while parked. This feature helps you track and monitor your vehicle even when it's not in use. If the vehicle is moved without authorization, you will receive a push notification alerting you about the movement.

- **Enable notifications for unauthorized vehicle movements**: Activate this feature to receive alerts when your vehicle moves unexpectedly. This helps you monitor your vehicle’s safety when parked in vulnerable areas.

Parking Mode helps protect your vehicles against theft or unauthorized usage, providing you with peace of mind when the vehicle is not in operation.
