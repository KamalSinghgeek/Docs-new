The **Immobilization** feature allows you to remotely disable a vehicle's engine to prevent unauthorized usage. This tool is especially useful for managing the security of your fleet and ensuring that vehicles cannot be used without permission.

---

### **Enable or Disable the Immobilization Feature**:

- **Toggle On/Off**: Use the toggle switch to enable or disable the immobilization feature on any selected vehicle. When activated, the vehicle’s engine will be disabled, preventing it from being started or used.
- **Security Control**: This feature adds an extra layer of security, allowing fleet managers to stop a vehicle from being driven if it is reported stolen, used without authorization, or in need of service.

This functionality gives you the ability to control vehicle operations remotely, enhancing fleet security and helping to protect your assets.
