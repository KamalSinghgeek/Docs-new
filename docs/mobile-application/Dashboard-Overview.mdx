The **Dashboard** provides a comprehensive overview of the fleet's performance, offering real-time data on the vehicles and their status. The following features are available on the dashboard:

- **Total Vehicles and Their Status**: The dashboard displays the total number of vehicles in the fleet, along with their current status. The status options include:

  - **Running**: Vehicles that are actively in use.
  - **Stopped**: Vehicles that are not in use.
  - **Idle**: Vehicles that are inactive but still running (e.g., the engine is on).
  - **Inactive**: Vehicles that have not transmitted data in the last 48 hours.
  - **No Data**: Vehicles that haven't connected to the server.

- **Total Kilometers Traveled**: The dashboard shows the total distance traveled by the vehicles, presented in a graphical format. This allows administrators to quickly assess the overall distance covered by the fleet and identify any trends or discrepancies in vehicle usage.

- **Real-Time Tracking**: From the dashboard, you can quickly access real-time tracking of all vehicles. The map view clusters all vehicles and allows you to zoom in for more detailed tracking. Clicking on any vehicle cluster reveals the exact location of each vehicle.

These features offer an intuitive interface for managing fleet operations, providing administrators with critical insights into vehicle status and performance at a glance.
