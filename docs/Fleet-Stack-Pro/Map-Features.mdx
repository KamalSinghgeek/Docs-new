Fleet Stack Pro’s map features provide you with a powerful tool to visualize and manage your fleet in real time. Access vehicle details, control actions remotely, and adjust map settings—all from one place.

### **Accessing the Map Page**

The map page provides an intuitive way to view all vehicles in your fleet, clustered by their current location. This feature helps you quickly see where each vehicle is, making it easier to manage your fleet efficiently.

- **View Vehicles on the Map**: All vehicles will be displayed as markers, organized by location.
- **Clustered View**: Vehicles will be grouped in clusters based on their proximity to each other, making it easier to get an overview.
