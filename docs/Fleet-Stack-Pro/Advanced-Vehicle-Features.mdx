## **Tracking Link Creation**

The **Tracking Link Creation** feature lets you generate a unique tracking link for any vehicle. This allows you to share the vehicle's live location with others in real-time. You can easily create, share, or delete the tracking link with a few simple steps.

### Steps to Create a Tracking Link:

1. **Select a Vehicle**: Choose the vehicle you wish to track from your list.
2. **Create Tracking Link**: Tap the **Create Tracking Link** button to generate the link.
3. **Share Link**: Tap **Share** to send the tracking link to others.
4. **Delete Link**: If you no longer need the link, simply use the **Delete Button** to remove it.

    }}

## **Immobilize Vehicle**

The **Immobilize Vehicle** feature allows you to remotely control a vehicle's engine. Whether you need to stop the engine for security purposes or restart it, this feature gives you the power to do so from anywhere. This can be useful for stopping unauthorized use or protecting your vehicle in certain situations.

### Steps to Immobilize or Start the Engine:

1. **Remotely Immobilize Vehicle**: Tap the **Stop Engine** button (Red) to immobilize the vehicle.
2. **Start Engine**: Tap the **Start Engine** button (Green) to start the vehicle.
3. **Wait Time**: It may take 2-5 minutes for the results to reflect, as the system fetches data from the server.

      boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
  />
</div>

## **Parking Mode**

The **Parking Mode** feature allows you to activate or deactivate notifications related to your vehicle’s parking status. When parking mode is activated, you’ll be notified if the vehicle is moved or if it leaves the designated parking area. This feature helps you stay aware of any unauthorized movement when your vehicle is parked.

### How Parking Mode Works:

1. **Activate Parking Mode**: Turn on parking mode to receive notifications about the parking status of your vehicle.
2. **Deactivate Parking Mode**: Turn it off when you no longer want to receive parking-related notifications.

    display: 'flex',

      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
  />
