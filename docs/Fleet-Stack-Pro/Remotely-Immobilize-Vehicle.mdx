The **Remotely Immobilize Vehicle** feature allows you to control a vehicle's engine remotely, either starting or stopping it from a distance. This is especially useful for situations where you need to secure a vehicle or prevent unauthorized movement.

### **How to Use Remotely Immobilize Vehicle:**

- **Start Engine** (Green): Tap this option to remotely start the vehicle's engine. This can be useful in situations where the vehicle needs to be started from a distance.
- **Stop Engine** (Red): Tap this option to remotely stop the engine of the vehicle. This is often used to prevent unauthorized movement or to immobilize a vehicle in case of an emergency.

### **Important Notes:**

- It may take **2-5 minutes** for the system to fetch the result from the server, depending on network conditions and other factors. Please be patient while the system processes the command.
