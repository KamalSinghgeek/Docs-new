Geofencing is a powerful tool that allows you to create virtual boundaries around specific areas and receive alerts when a vehicle enters or exits these predefined zones. It's particularly useful for monitoring vehicle movements and ensuring fleet compliance with designated routes.

### **Setting Up a Geofence**

To set up a Geofence for your vehicles, follow these simple steps:

1. **Access Geofencing Options:**

   - Open the Fleet Stack app and navigate to the **Geofence** section under the **Settings** menu.

2. **Define a Geofence Area:**

   - Choose a location on the map to define the boundaries for your Geofence. You can draw the perimeter manually or set a radius around a specific point.

3. **Set Up Alerts:**

   - Configure notifications to alert you when a vehicle enters or exits the Geofenced area. You can adjust the alert settings based on your preferences, such as receiving an email or in-app notification.

4. **Save and Activate:**
   - Once you've defined the area and set up alerts, save the Geofence and activate it. Your vehicles will now be monitored based on the set boundaries.

### **Use Cases for Geofencing**

- **Fleet Monitoring:** Track vehicle movements within specific zones (e.g., restricted areas or delivery zones).
- **Security:** Receive alerts when vehicles enter or exit a specific location, helping prevent unauthorized access.
- **Compliance:** Ensure drivers adhere to designated routes or boundaries set by the organization.
- **Efficiency:** Optimize routes and reduce time spent in unauthorized or off-route areas.

By using **Geofencing** effectively, you can enhance your fleet management by gaining real-time insights into vehicle movements and ensuring that your fleet stays within designated boundaries, improving security, compliance, and efficiency.
